                <br>

                <p>Discover all the new models of this exclusive car family, created to shape to your deepest emotions. Combining the highest expression of Lamborghini’s power with the exclusive refinement of Italian handicraft, this series embodies authentic design and state-of-the-art mechanical technology. The Lamborghini Huracán is the perfect fusion of technology and design. With its crisp, streamlined lines, designed to cut through the air and tame the road, you’ll get a thrill just by looking at it. The only thing better than taking in this beauty from a distance is actually touching it. The finest Italian craftsmanship lavished on finishes of unprecedented prestige and quality.</p>
                <br>

                <h2>Engine</h2>
                <p>The Huracán maintains the 5.2-litre naturally aspirated Audi/Lamborghini V10 engine with an additional 0.2 litres, compared to the Gallardo, tuned to generate a maximum power output of 449 kW (602 hp; 610 PS). To ensure its balance and performance, the car is mid-engined. The engine has both direct fuel injection and multi-point fuel injection. It combines the benefits of both of these systems; it is the first time this combination is used in a V10 engine. To increase its efficiency, the Huracán's engine also includes a start-stop system.[citation needed] The firing order of the engine is 1, 6, 5, 10, 2, 7, 3, 8, 4, 9. This is printed on a metal plate on the top of the engine, as with all other Lamborghini models.

                    The drag coefficient of Cd=0.39 was undisclosed until 2021.</p>

                <h2>Performance</h2>
                <p>With a curb weight of 1,553 kg (3,424 lb), the Huracán LP 610-4 has a power-to-weight ratio of 2.55 kg (5.62 lb) per horsepower.</p>
                <br>

                <h2>Technology</h2>
                <p>Various aspects of the Huracán are technologically advanced. The car has full LED headlamps, which ensure higher contrast in night conditions. Also, the Huracán has optional "Lamborghini Dynamic Steering" (LDS) to add to the standard power steering. The Dynamic Steering changes the steering performance from normal, comfortable steering to a racing feeling. The main control for changing the car's performance according to driving conditions is the mode selector Adaptive Network Intelligent Management.ANIMA controls the engine, the transmission, LDS, the all-wheel drive, magnetorheological suspension, and the electronic stability control. The Lamborghini Piattaforma Inerziale (LPI) carries out precise measurements of the vehicle movements using on board sensors (3 accelerometers and 3 gyroscopes) linked to ANIMA through high-speed FlexRay CAN bus.The driver can select street, sport, or race mode to alter how systems like the engine or transmission respond while driving.</p>

                <p>The Ferrari 458 Italia has garnered over 30 international awards in its career. It added two further plaudits to that collection at the International Engine of the Year Awards when its V8 was voted “Best Performance Engine” and “Best Engine Above 4 Litres”. The success being enjoyed by the 458 Italia with both critics and public alike crosses all borders</p>
                <br>

                <h2>Engine</h2>
        
                <p>The 458 is powered by a 4,497 cc (4.5 L; 274.4 cu in) engine of the "Ferrari/Maserati" F136 V8 family, generating a power output of 570 PS (419 kW; 562 hp) at 9,000 rpm (redline) and 540 N⋅m (398 lb⋅ft) of torque at 6,000 rpm with 80 percent of torque available at 3,250 rpm.The engine features direct fuel injection, a first for Ferrari mid-engine setups in its road cars.</p>
                <br>

                <h2>Transmission</h2>
                <p>The only transmission available on the 458 is a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox by Getrag, in a different state of tune shared with the Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG.There is no traditional manual option, making this the first mainstream model to not be offered with a manual transmission.</p>
                <br>

                <h2>Performance</h2>
                <p>Ferrari's official 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) acceleration is 3.4 seconds.[12] The top speed is over 325 km/h (202 mph).[12] It has fuel consumption in combined cycle (ECE+EUDC) of 13.3 L/100 km (21.2 mpg‑imp; 17.7 mpg‑US) while producing 307 g/km of CO2.</p>
